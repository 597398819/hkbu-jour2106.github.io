<h2> Course Introduction </h2>

<p>
  As data becomes increasingly important in news reporting, this course helps students learn the fundamental principles, tools and workflow to visualise data. Each class is composed of half lecture session and half lab session so that students can get adequate guided exercises. The course mainly focuses on data visualisation although it covers basic data analytics and data journalism workflow just to be self-contained. Among many visualisation techniques and tools, this course focuses on the web stack, because most content are distributed via (mobile) web-based technology at present. Students will learn the end-to-end production and deployment of a web-based story, foundations of HTML/CSS/Javascript and visualisation libraries likes eCharts, D3, Leaflet, ... By finishing this course, students are expected to build one web-based data visualisation news story and distribute the project via their own websites.
